I am a doctor student in the University of Tokyo. My major is precision engineerging. I am now studing how to extract the depth information using Structured Illumination Microscope, which may be a good technology for observing micrograves on silicon wafer with several hundred nanometers width. My superviser is Satoru Takahashi, who is a professor teaching in Utokyo for many years.  I received my bachelor degree in Tohoku University and master degree in the University of Tokyo
